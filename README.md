Project 1 
Password manager

Welcome to the Password Manager project. This is a simple command-line tool written in Python for managing passwords securely.

Features
Add Passwords: Store passwords along with website names and usernames.
View Passwords: Display all stored passwords.
Security: Ensures passwords are stored securely within a local text file.

Skills Demonstrated
File Handling
I've implemented file operations (open, read, write) to securely store and retrieve passwords.

User Input and Output
Manage user interactions through command-line prompts (input) and display information (print) based on user actions.

Basic Data Structures
Utilize basic data structures like strings to manage and structure password information effectively.

Error Handling
I handle exceptions like file not found errors using try-except blocks during file operations.

Functions
Modularize code with functions to encapsulate tasks such as adding passwords, viewing passwords, and handling user input.
